## Getting Started  
This project is under active development. Setup instructions will be added as the app evolves.  

For now, the basic workflow will be:  
1. Clone the repo.  
2. Install dependencies in both `frontend` and `backend`.  
3. Create a `.env` file to store API keys (Brightspace, Google, Spotify).  
4. Run backend and frontend servers.
